## Project Summary

This project showcases the creation of a sophisticated backend system using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **Express.js**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: A document-oriented NoSQL database.
- **Mongoose**: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- **Bcrypt**: A password-hashing function.
- **Nodemailer**: A module for Node.js applications to send emails.

Key features of the system include:

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup processes using JWT and bcrypt.
- **Product Management**: Full CRUD operations for products.
- **Order Management**: Comprehensive order placement and status update functionalities.
- **Email Notifications**: Automated email notifications for order status changes.
- **Transaction Management**: Ensures data consistency with Mongoose transactions.

This project adheres to industry-standard practices, employing JWT for authentication, bcrypt for password hashing, and secure email notifications to ensure a robust and scalable backend system.

## Key Features

- **Authentication**: Implements secure user authentication with JWT and bcrypt.
- **Product Management**: Facilitates the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of products.
- **Order Management**: Manages order placement, status updates, and related email notifications.
- **Security**: Utilizes access and refresh tokens to secure API endpoints.
- **Transaction Management**: Guarantees data consistency through Mongoose transactions.
